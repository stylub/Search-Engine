A music performer is generally either a singer, who provides vocals, or an instrumentalist, who plays a musical instrument. Musicians may perform on their own or as part of a group, band or orchestra. Musicians can specialize in a musical genre, though many play a variety of different styles, depending on the cultures and backgrounds involved. A musician who records and releases music can be known as a recording artist.[3]\n"}
