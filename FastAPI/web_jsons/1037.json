{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collection_manager", "title": "Collection manager", "content": "A collection manager ensures the proper care and preservation of objects within cultural institutions such as museums, libraries, and archives. Collection managers, along with registrars, curators, and conservators, play an important role in collections care.  Collection Managers and Registrars are two distinct collection roles that are often combined into one within small to mid-size cultural institutions. Collection Managers can be found in large museums and those with a history and natural history\nfocus whose diverse collections require experienced assessment to properly sort, catalog, and store artifacts.[1] A collection manager may oversee the registrar, archivist, curator, photographer, or other collection professionals, and may assume the responsibilities of these roles in their absence within an organization.[2]\n"}
