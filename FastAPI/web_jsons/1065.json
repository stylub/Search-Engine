{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_knowledge_officer", "title": "Chief knowledge officer", "content": "A chief knowledge officer (CKO) is a loosely defined role in some organizations that achieved some prominence during the 1990s and 2000s that supervises knowledge management.  In general, their duties involve intellectual capital and organizing preservation and distribution of knowledge in an organization.[1]  The position sometimes overlaps with the title of \"chief information officer\"; CIOs tend to be more focused on information technology within an organization (computer systems and the like), while CKOs have more nebulous portfolios including matters such as overseeing patent applications, internal training and documentation, knowledge sharing, and promoting innovative research.\n"}
