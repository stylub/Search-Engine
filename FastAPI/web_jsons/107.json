{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality", "title": "Augmented reality", "content": "Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience that combines the real world and computer-generated content. The content can span multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory and olfactory.[1] AR can be defined as a system that incorporates three basic features: a combination of real and virtual worlds, real-time interaction, and accurate 3D registration of virtual and real objects.[2] The overlaid sensory information can be constructive (i.e. additive to the natural environment), or destructive (i.e. masking of the natural environment).[3] As such, it is one of the key technologies in the reality-virtuality continuum.[4]\n"}
