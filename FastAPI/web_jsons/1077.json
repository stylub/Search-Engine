{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_risk_officer", "title": "Chief risk officer", "content": "The chief risk officer (CRO), chief risk management officer (CRMO), or chief risk and compliance officer[1] (CRCO) of a firm or corporation is the executive accountable for enabling the efficient and effective governance of significant risks, and related opportunities, to a business and its various segments.[2] Risks are commonly categorized as strategic, reputational, operational, financial, or compliance-related. CROs are accountable to the Executive Committee and The Board for enabling the business to balance risk and reward.  In more complex organizations, they are generally responsible for coordinating the organization's Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) approach. The CRO is responsible for assessing and mitigating significant competitive, regulatory, and technological threats to a firm's capital and earnings. The CRO roles and responsibilities vary depending on the size of the organization and industry. The CRO works to ensure that the firm is compliant with government regulations, such as Sarbanes\u2013Oxley, and reviews factors that could negatively affect investments. Typically, the CRO is responsible for the firm's risk management operations, including managing, identifying, evaluating, reporting  and overseeing the firm's risks externally and internally  to the organization and works diligently with senior management such as chief executive officer and chief financial officer.\n"}
