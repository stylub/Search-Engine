{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_sustainability_officer", "title": "Chief sustainability officer", "content": "The chief sustainability officer, sometimes known by other titles, is the corporate title of an executive position within a corporation that is in charge of the corporation's \"environmental\" programs.  Several companies have created such environmental manager positions in the 21st century to formalize their commitment to the environment.  The rise of the investor ESG (Environment, Social and Governance) movement and stakeholder capitalism, has increased the need for corporations to address sustainability and social issues across their value chain, and address growing needs of external stakeholders.[1]  Normally these responsibilities rest with the facility manager, who has provided cost effective resource and environmental control as part of the basic services necessary for the company to function.  However, as sustainability initiatives have expanded beyond the facility \u2014 so has the importance of the position to what is now a C-level executive role.  The position of CSO has not been standardized across industries and individual companies which leads it to take on differing roles depending on the organization.\u00a0 The position has also been challenged as symbolic, in that it does not actually have the effect of increasing sustainable practices.\n"}
