{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_visionary_officer", "title": "Chief visionary officer", "content": "A chief visionary officer or chief vision officer (CVO) is an executive function in a company like a CEO or COO. The title is sometimes used to formalize a high-level advisory position and other times used to define a higher-ranking position than that held by the CEO. In some cases, the CVO is added to the CEO-title (for CEO/CVO status), much in the same way that people with multiple university degrees list them after their names.\n"}
