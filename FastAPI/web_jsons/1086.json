{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_director", "title": "Development director", "content": "A development director or director of development is the senior fundraising manager of a non-profit organization, company, or corporation. The position works closely with a chief financial officer (CFO) or treasurer. A director of development is chiefly responsible for bringing in revenue streams to a non-profit (grants, donations, special events), and a CFO is responsible for the fiscal management of the organization. A CFO is rarely assigned to write grant narratives, but may oversee the budget section of a grant application or a fiscal report for a grant. Some larger organizations (especially those that have large government grants) have a grants manager as well as a grant writer/director of development.  A grants manager assists the CFO with grant reports and grant-related accounting. A development director is usually remunerated for his or her work,[1] and in best practices for nonprofit organizations, development directors earn salaries.  Commissions are still considered unethical by professional organizations such as the Grant Professionals Association (GPA) and the Association of Fundraising Professionals (AFP), but the practice of commission-based remuneration depends on the state of the economy.[2]\n"}
