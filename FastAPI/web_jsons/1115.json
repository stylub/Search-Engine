{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_group", "title": "Focus group", "content": "A focus group is a group interview involving a small number (sometimes up to ten) of demographically similar participants. Their reactions to specific researcher/evaluator-posed questions are studied. Focus groups are used in market research to better understand people's reactions to products or services or participants' perceptions of shared experiences. The discussions can be guided or open. In market research, focus groups can explore a group's response to a new product or service. As a program evaluation tool, they can elicit lessons learned and recommendations for performance improvement. The idea is for the researcher to understand participants' reactions. If group members are representative of a larger population, those reactions may be expected to reflect the views of that larger population.[1][2][3] Thus, focus groups constitute a research or evaluation method that researchers organize to collect qualitative data through interactive and directed discussions.[4]\n"}
