{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_library", "title": "Runtime library", "content": "In computer programming, a runtime library is a set of low-level routines used by a compiler to invoke some of the behaviors of a runtime environment, by inserting calls to the runtime library into compiled executable binary.   The runtime environment implements the execution model, built-in functions, and other fundamental behaviors of a programming language.[1]  During execution (run time) of that computer program, execution of those calls to the runtime library cause communication between the executable binary and the runtime environment.  A runtime library often includes built-in functions for memory management or exception handling.[2]  Therefore, a runtime library is always specific to the platform and compiler.\n"}
