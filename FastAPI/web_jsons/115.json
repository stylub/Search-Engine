It has traditionally been held in October, though some more recent editions were contested in November due to expanded playoffs and/or season delays.   It has been contested since 1903 between the champion teams of the American League (AL) and the National League (NL). The winner of the World Series championship is determined through a best-of-seven playoff, and the winning team is awarded the Commissioner's Trophy.[1]\n"}
