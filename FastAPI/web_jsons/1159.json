{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illumos", "title": "Illumos", "content": "Illumos (stylized as illumos) is a partly[3] free and open-source Unix operating system. It is based on OpenSolaris, which was based on System V Release 4 (SVR4) and the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD). Illumos comprises a kernel, device drivers, system libraries, and utility software for system administration. This core is now the base for many different open-sourced Illumos distributions,[4] in a similar way in which the Linux kernel is used in different Linux distributions.[5]\n"}
