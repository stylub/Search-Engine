{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_i", "title": "IBM i", "content": "IBM i (the i standing for integrated)[6] is an operating system developed by IBM for IBM Power Systems.[7] It was originally released in 1988 as OS/400, as the sole operating system of the IBM AS/400 line of systems. It was renamed to i5/OS in 2004, before being renamed a second time to IBM i in 2008.[8][9] It is an evolution of the System/38 CPF operating system,[5] with compatibility layers for System/36 SSP and AIX applications.[5] It inherits a number of distinctive features from the System/38 platform, including the Machine Interface, the implementation of object-based addressing on top of a single-level store, and the tight integration of a relational database into the operating system.[1]\n"}
