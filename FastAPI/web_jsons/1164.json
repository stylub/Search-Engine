{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2", "title": "OS/2", "content": "OS/2 (Operating System/2) is a series of computer operating systems, initially created by Microsoft and IBM under the leadership of IBM software designer Ed Iacobucci.[2] As a result of a feud between the two companies over how to position OS/2 relative to Microsoft's new Windows 3.1 operating environment,[3] the two companies severed the relationship in 1992 and OS/2 development fell to IBM exclusively.[4] The name stands for \"Operating System/2\", because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as IBM's \"Personal System/2 (PS/2)\" line of second-generation personal computers. The first version of OS/2 was initially released in December 1987, and newer versions were released until December 2001.\n"}
