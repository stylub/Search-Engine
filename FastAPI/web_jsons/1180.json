{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KaiOS", "title": "KaiOS", "content": "KaiOS is a mobile Linux distribution for keypad feature phones based on the Firefox OS open-source project.[6] It is developed by KaiOS Technologies (Hong Kong) Limited; a company based in Hong Kong, whose largest shareholder is Chinese electronics conglomerate TCL Corporation.[7][1] KaiOS runs on feature phones or wireless home phones made with low-power hardware and low power consumption (and therefore long battery life). KaiOS supports modern connectivity technologies like 4G LTE, VoLTE, GPS, and Wi-Fi. KaiOS runs HTML5-based apps. KaiOS supports over-the-air updates and has a dedicated app marketplace called KaiStore.[8] Some applications are preinstalled onto the phone, including Facebook and YouTube.[9] As of 1\u00a0April\u00a02020[update], there are 500+ apps in KaiStore. The mobile operating system is comparatively lightweight on hardware resource usage, and is able to run on devices with just 256 megabytes (MB) of memory.[10]\n"}
