{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_genre", "title": "Video game genre", "content": "A video game genre is an informal classification of a video game based on how it is played rather than visual or narrative elements.[1][2] This is independent of setting, unlike works of fiction that are expressed through other media, such as films or books. For example, a shooter game is still a shooter game, regardless of where or when it takes place.[3][4] A specific game's genre is open to subjective interpretation. An individual game may belong to several genres at once.[1]\n"}
