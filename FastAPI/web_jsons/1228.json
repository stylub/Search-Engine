Since 2013, Raspberry Pi devices have been developed and supported by a subsidiary of the Raspberry Pi Foundation, now named Raspberry Pi Ltd.[3] The Raspberry Pi project originally leaned toward the promotion of teaching basic computer science in schools.[4][5][6] The original model became more popular than anticipated,[7] selling outside its target market for diverse uses such as robotics, home and industrial automation, and by computer and electronic hobbyists, because of its low cost, modularity, open design, and its adoption of the HDMI and USB standards.\n"}
