{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible", "title": "IBM PC compatible", "content": "IBM PC compatible computers are similar to the original IBM PC, XT, and AT, all from computer giant IBM, that are able to use the same software and expansion cards.  Such computers were referred to as PC clones, IBM clones or IBM PC  clones. The term \"IBM PC compatible\" is now a historical description only, since IBM no longer sells personal computers after it sold its personal computer division in 2005 to Chinese technology company Lenovo. The designation \"PC\", as used in much of personal computer history, has not meant \"personal computer\" generally, but rather an x86 computer capable of running the same software that a contemporary IBM PC could. The term was initially in contrast to the variety of home computer systems available in the early 1980s, such as the Apple II, TRS-80, and Commodore 64. Later, the term was primarily used in contrast to Apple's Macintosh computers. \n"}
