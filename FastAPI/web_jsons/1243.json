{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer", "title": "Supercomputer", "content": "A supercomputer is a type of computer with a high level of performance as compared to a general-purpose computer. The performance of a supercomputer is commonly measured in floating-point operations per second (FLOPS) instead of million instructions per second (MIPS). Since 2017, supercomputers have existed, which can perform over 1017\u00a0FLOPS (a hundred quadrillion FLOPS, 100\u00a0petaFLOPS or 100\u00a0PFLOPS).[3] For comparison, a desktop computer has performance in the range of hundreds of gigaFLOPS (1011) to tens of teraFLOPS (1013).[4][5] Since November 2017, all of the world's fastest 500 supercomputers run on Linux-based operating systems.[6] Additional research is being conducted in the United States, the European Union, Taiwan, Japan, and China to build faster, more powerful and technologically superior exascale supercomputers.[7]\n"}
