{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_virtualization", "title": "Hardware virtualization", "content": "Hardware virtualization is the virtualization of computers as complete hardware platforms, certain logical abstractions of their componentry, or only the functionality required to run various operating systems. Virtualization hides the physical characteristics of a computing platform from the users, presenting instead an abstract computing platform.[1][2] At its origins, the software that controlled virtualization was called a \"control program\", but the terms \"hypervisor\" or \"virtual machine monitor\" became preferred over time.[3]\n"}
