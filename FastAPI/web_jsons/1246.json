It was promoted as inter-dependencies between mobile computing, social media, cloud computing, and information / analytics (big data),[3][4][5] and possibly the Internet of things.[6] The term was in use in 2013, and possibly earlier. Gartner claimed that these interdependent trends were \"transforming the way people and businesses relate to technology\" and have since provided a number of reports on the topic.[7]\n"}
