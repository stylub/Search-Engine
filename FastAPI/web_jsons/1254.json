{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board", "title": "Printed circuit board", "content": "A printed circuit board (PCB), also called printed wiring board (PWB), is a medium used to connect or \"wire\" components to one another in a circuit. It takes the form of a laminated sandwich structure of conductive and insulating layers: each of the conductive layers is designed with a pattern of traces, planes and other features (similar to wires on a flat surface) etched from one or more sheet layers of copper laminated onto and/or between sheet layers of a non-conductive substrate.[1] Electrical components may be fixed to conductive pads on the outer layers in the shape designed to accept the component's terminals, generally by means of soldering, to both electrically connect and mechanically fasten them to it. Another manufacturing process adds vias, plated-through holes that allow interconnections between layers.\n"}
