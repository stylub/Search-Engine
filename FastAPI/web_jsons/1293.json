{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation", "title": "Theory of computation", "content": "In theoretical computer science and mathematics, the theory of computation is the branch that deals with what problems can be solved on a model of computation, using an algorithm, how efficiently they can be solved or to what degree (e.g., approximate solutions versus precise ones).  The field is divided into three major branches: automata theory and formal languages, computability theory, and computational complexity theory, which are linked by the question: \"What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?\".[1]\n"}
