{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_efficiency", "title": "Algorithmic efficiency", "content": "\nIn computer science, algorithmic efficiency is a property of an algorithm which relates to the amount of computational resources used by the algorithm. An algorithm must be analyzed to determine its resource usage, and the efficiency of an algorithm can be measured based on the usage of different resources. Algorithmic efficiency can be thought of as analogous to engineering productivity for a repeating or continuous process.\n"}
