{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multithreading_(computer_architecture)", "title": "Multithreading (computer architecture)", "content": "In computer architecture, multithreading is the ability of a central processing unit (CPU) (or a single core in a multi-core processor) to provide multiple threads of execution concurrently, supported by the operating system. This approach differs from multiprocessing. In a multithreaded application, the threads share the resources of a single or multiple cores, which include the computing units, the CPU caches, and the translation lookaside buffer (TLB).\n"}
