Knowledge representation incorporates findings from psychology[1] about how humans solve problems and represent knowledge, in order to design formalisms that will make complex systems easier to design and build.  Knowledge representation and reasoning also incorporates findings from logic to automate various kinds of reasoning.\n"}
