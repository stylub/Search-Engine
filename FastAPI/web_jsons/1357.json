{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_artificial_intelligence", "title": "Philosophy of artificial intelligence", "content": "The philosophy of artificial intelligence is a branch of the philosophy of mind and the philosophy of computer science[1] that explores artificial intelligence and its implications for knowledge and understanding of intelligence, ethics, consciousness, epistemology, and free will.[2][3] Furthermore, the technology is concerned with the creation of artificial animals or artificial people (or, at least, artificial creatures; see artificial life) so the discipline is of considerable interest to philosophers.[4] These factors contributed to the emergence of the philosophy of artificial intelligence. \n"}
