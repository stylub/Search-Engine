{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)", "title": "Cross-validation (statistics)", "content": "Cross-validation,[2][3][4] sometimes called rotation estimation[5][6][7] or out-of-sample testing, is any of various similar model validation techniques for assessing how the results of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent data set.\nCross-validation includes resampling and sample splitting methods that use different portions of the data to test and train a model on different iterations. It is often used in settings where the goal is prediction, and one wants to estimate how accurately a predictive model will perform in practice. It can also be used to assess the quality of a fitted model and the stability of its parameters.\n"}
