{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_engineering", "title": "Computational engineering", "content": "Computational Engineering is an emerging discipline that deals with the development and application of computational models for engineering, known as Computational Engineering Models[1] or CEM. Computational engineering uses computers to solve engineering design problems important to a variety of industries.[2] At this time, various different approaches are summarized under the term Computational Engineering, including using computational geometry and virtual design for engineering tasks,[3][4] often coupled with a simulation-driven approach[5] In Computational Engineering, algorithms solve mathematical and logical models[6] that describe engineering challenges, sometimes coupled with some aspect of AI, specifically Reinforcement Learning.[7]\n"}
