{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window", "title": "Window", "content": "A window is an opening in a wall, door, roof, or vehicle that allows passage of light and sound and sometimes air and enables an outside viewing by individuals. Modern windows are usually glazed or covered in some other transparent or translucent material, a sash set in a frame[1] in the opening; the sash and frame are also referred to as a window.[2] Many glazed windows may be opened, to allow ventilation, or closed, to exclude inclement weather. Windows may have a latch or similar mechanism to lock the window shut or to hold it open by various amounts.\n"}
