{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer", "title": "Multiplayer video game", "content": "A multiplayer video game is a video game in which more than one person can play in the same game environment at the same time[1], either locally on the same computing system (couch co-op), on different computing systems via a local area network, or via a wide area network, most commonly the Internet (e.g. World of Warcraft, Call of Duty, DayZ). Multiplayer games usually require players to share a single game system or use networking technology to play together over a greater distance; players may compete against one or more human contestants, work cooperatively with a human partner to achieve a common goal, or supervise other players' activity. Due to multiplayer games allowing players to interact with other individuals, they provide an element of social communication absent from single-player games.\n"}
