{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86", "title": "x86", "content": "x86 (also known as 80x86[2] or the 8086 family[3]) is a family of complex instruction set computer (CISC) instruction set architectures[a] initially developed by Intel based on the Intel 8086 microprocessor and its 8088 variant. The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address. The term \"x86\" came into being because the names of several successors to Intel's 8086 processor end in \"86\", including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors. Colloquially, their names were \"186\", \"286\", \"386\" and \"486\".\n"}
