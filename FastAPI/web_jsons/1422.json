{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS", "title": "MS-DOS", "content": "MS-DOS (/\u02cc\u025bm\u02cc\u025bs\u02c8d\u0252s/ em-es-DOSS; acronym for Microsoft Disk Operating System, also known as Microsoft DOS) is an operating system for x86-based personal computers mostly developed by Microsoft. Collectively, MS-DOS, its rebranding as IBM PC\u00a0DOS, and a few operating systems attempting to be compatible with MS-DOS, are sometimes referred to as \"DOS\" (which is also the generic acronym for disk operating system). MS-DOS was the main operating system for IBM PC compatibles during the 1980s, from which point it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system.\n"}
