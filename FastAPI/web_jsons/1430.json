The term workstation has been used loosely to refer to everything from a mainframe computer terminal to a PC connected to a network, but the most common form refers to the class of hardware offered by several current and defunct companies such as Sun Microsystems,[3] Silicon Graphics, Apollo Computer,[4] DEC, HP, NeXT, and IBM which powered the 3D computer graphics revolution of the late 1990s.[5]\n"}
