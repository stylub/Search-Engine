{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_shortcut", "title": "Keyboard shortcut", "content": "In computing, a keyboard shortcut also known as hotkey is a series of one or several keys to quickly invoke a software program or perform a preprogrammed action. This action may be part of the standard functionality of the operating system or application program, or it may have been written by the user in a scripting language. Some integrated keyboards also include pointing devices; the definition of exactly what counts as a \"key\" sometimes differs. \n"}
