{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paging", "title": "Memory paging", "content": "\nIn computer operating systems, memory paging (or swapping on some Unix-like systems) is a memory management scheme by which a computer stores and retrieves data from secondary storage[a] for use in main memory.[citation needed] In this scheme, the operating system retrieves data from secondary storage in same-size blocks called pages. Paging is an important part of virtual memory implementations in modern operating systems, using secondary storage to let programs exceed the size of available physical memory.\n"}
