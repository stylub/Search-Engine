{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_mode", "title": "Real mode", "content": "Real mode, also called real address mode, is an operating mode of all x86-compatible CPUs. The mode gets its name from the fact that addresses in real mode always correspond to real locations in memory. Real mode is characterized by a 20-bit segmented memory address space (giving 1 MB of addressable memory) and unlimited direct software access to all addressable memory, I/O addresses and peripheral hardware.  Real mode provides no support for memory protection, multitasking, or code privilege levels.\n"}
