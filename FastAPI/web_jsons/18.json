{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-play", "title": "Free-to-play", "content": "Free-to-play (F2P or FtP) video games are games that give players access to a significant portion of their content without paying or do not require paying to continue playing. Free-to-play is distinct from traditional commercial software, which requires a payment before using the game or service. It is also separate from freeware games, which are entirely costless. Free-to-play's model is sometimes derisively referred to as free-to-start due to not being entirely free.[1] Free to play games have also been widely criticized as \"pay-to-win\"\u2014 that is, that players can generally pay to obtain competitive or power advantages over other players.\n"}
