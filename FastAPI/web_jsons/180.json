She was introduced as a playable character, or \"Champion\" within series lore, in a December 2012 update for the 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game of the same name, which was complemented by an official upload track to commemorate her introduction. She is presented as an impulsive and contemptuous woman who uses a massive pair of gauntlets powered with magical energy as her weapon of choice. Although she is nicknamed The Piltover Enforcer because of her association with the city's Guardians, she is a former criminal who hails from Zaun, originally the undercity region of Piltover. She is the archenemy as well as elder sister of the terrorist Jinx, another League of Legends Champion.\n"}
