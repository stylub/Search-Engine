{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOL", "title": "LOL", "content": "LOL, or lol, is an initialism for laughing out loud[1][2][3][4] and a popular element of Internet slang. It was first used almost exclusively on Usenet, but has since become widespread in other forms of computer-mediated communication and even face-to-face communication. It is one of many initialisms for expressing bodily reactions, in particular laughter, as text, including initialisms for more emphatic expressions of laughter such as LMAO[5] (\"laughing my ass off\") and ROFL[6][7][8] or ROTFL[9][10] (\"rolling on the floor laughing\").\n"}
