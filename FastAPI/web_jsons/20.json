{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player-versus-player", "title": "Player versus player", "content": "Player versus player (PVP) is a type of multiplayer interactive conflict within a game between human players.[1] This is often compared to player versus environment (PvE), in which the game itself controls its players' opponents. The terms are most often used in games where both activities exist,[2] particularly MMORPGs, MUDs, and other role-playing video games, to distinguish between gamemodes. PvP can be broadly used to describe any game, or aspect of a game, where players compete against each other. PvP is often controversial when used in role-playing games. In most cases, there are vast differences in abilities between players. PvP can even encourage experienced players to immediately attack and kill inexperienced players.[3] PvP is often referred to as player killing in the cases of games which contain, but do not focus on, such interaction.\n"}
