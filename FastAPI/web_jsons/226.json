From 2013 to 2017, the VCS was a tier below Garena Premier League (GPL). In 2018, the VCS broke away from the GPL and became a separate tier one league. The Vietnamese teams have the opportunity to participate directly in international events of League of Legends organized by Riot Games without having to participate in the GPL.[1]\n"}
