The two highest-placing teams from the Challenger Series played in the League of Legends Promotion Tournament against the two lowest-placing League of Legends Championship Series (LCS) teams, the winners of which were promoted to the Championship Series in each region, whereas the losers were relegated to the Challenger Series.[1] The league was announced in December 2013 and began play for the Spring 2014 season.[2] Both the NA and EU CS were discontinued in 2018 in preparation for league franchising.\n"}
