{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia", "title": "Encyclopedia", "content": "An encyclopedia (American English) or encyclopaedia (British English)[1] is a reference work or compendium providing summaries of knowledge, either general or special, to a particular field or discipline.[2][3] Encyclopedias are divided into articles or entries that are arranged alphabetically by article name[4] or by thematic categories, or else are hyperlinked and searchable.[5] Encyclopedia entries are longer and more detailed than those in most dictionaries.[4][6] Generally speaking, encyclopedia articles focus on factual information concerning the subject named in the article's title;[6] this is unlike dictionary entries, which focus on linguistic information about words, such as their etymology, meaning, pronunciation, use, and grammatical forms.[6][7][8][9][10]\n"}
