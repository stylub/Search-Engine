{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia,_a_Person_of_Quality", "title": "Sophia, a Person of Quality", "content": "\"Sophia, a Person of Quality\" was a pen name used by the author of two English protofeminist treatises published in the mid-18th century, following a period trend of women's histories and political tracts arguing in favor of equal rights known as the querelle des femmes. The first tract under the Sophia name, Woman Not Inferior to Man, was published in 1739. Largely adapting Fran\u00e7ois Poullain de la Barre's 1676 De l'\u00c9galit\u00e9 des deux sexes (\"On the Equality of the Two Sexes\"), Sophia expands on the text using Cartesian rhetoric to attack male superiority, with a focus on establishing the equality of women's abilities with men, as well as stating that women hold an inherent moral superiority. Following the publication in 1739 of an anonymous rebuttal tract, Man Superior to Woman, Sophia wrote a follow-up tract titled Woman's Superior Excellence Over Man. Published in 1740, the text accepts the rebuttal's challenge to prove the moral superiority of women in order to justify women's rights. All three of these tracts were later compiled and published as a single volume in 1751, entitled Beauty's Triumph.\n"}
