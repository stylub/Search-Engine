They were initially only used infrequently as writers preferred the planets as settings. The once-popular Pha\u00ebton hypothesis, which states that the asteroid belt consists of the remnants of the former fifth planet that existed in an orbit between Mars and Jupiter before somehow being destroyed, has been a recurring theme with various explanations for the planet's destruction proposed. This hypothetical former planet is in science fiction often called \"Bodia\" in reference to Johann Elert Bode, for whom the since-discredited Titius\u2013Bode law that predicts the planet's existence is named.\n"}
