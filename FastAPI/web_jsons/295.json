After releasing his 2010 single \"Say My Name\", Robinson expressed desire to explore different musical genres by producing an EP, diverging from his traditional eurodance style. Spanning a range of genres, Spitfire marked the inaugural release on Owsla and caused Beatport to crash following its promotion by musicians Skrillex and Ti\u00ebsto. The EP charted at UK Dance Albums, Dance/Electronic Albums and Heatseekers Albums, with Robinson subsequently embarking on a tour to promote it. Songs \"The State\" and \"Unison\" received particular attention for their libertarian themes and use in DJ sets, respectively.\n"}
