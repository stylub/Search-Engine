{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthyotitan", "title": "Ichthyotitan", "content": "Ichthyotitan is an extinct genus of giant ichthyosaur from the Late Triassic (Rhaetian), known from the Westbury Mudstone Formation in Somerset, United Kingdom. It is believed to be a shastasaurid, extending the family's range by 13 million years up to the latest Triassic. The discovery of Ichthyotitan has been considered evidence that shastasaurids were still thriving until their disappearance in the Triassic\u2013Jurassic extinction event.\n"}
