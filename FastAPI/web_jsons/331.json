{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_wars_in_Europe", "title": "Ottoman wars in Europe", "content": "A series of military conflicts between the Ottoman Empire and various European states took place from the Late Middle Ages up through the early 20th century. The earliest conflicts began during the Byzantine\u2013Ottoman wars, waged in Anatolia in the late 13th century before entering Europe in the mid-14th century with the Bulgarian\u2013Ottoman wars. The mid-15th century saw the Serbian\u2013Ottoman wars and the Albanian-Ottoman wars. Much of this period was characterized by the Ottoman expansion into the Balkans. The Ottoman Empire made further inroads into Central Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries, culminating in the peak of Ottoman territorial claims in Europe.[1][2]\n"}
