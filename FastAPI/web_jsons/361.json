{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perennial", "title": "Perennial", "content": "In botany, a perennial plant or simply perennial is a plant that lives more than two years.[1] The term (per- + -ennial, \"through the years\") is often used to differentiate a plant from shorter-lived annuals and biennials. The term is also widely used to distinguish plants with little or no woody growth (secondary growth in girth) from trees and shrubs, which are also technically perennials.[2] Notably, it is estimated that 94% of plant species fall under the category of perennials, underscoring the prevalence of plants with lifespans exceeding two years in the botanical world.[3]\n"}
