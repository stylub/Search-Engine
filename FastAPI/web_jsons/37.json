{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilibili", "title": "Bilibili", "content": "Bilibili (stylized in all lowercase), nicknamed B Site, is a video-sharing website based in Shanghai where users can submit, view, and add overlaid commentary on videos. Bilibili hosts videos on various themes, including anime, music, dance, science and technology, movies, drama, fashion, and video games, but it is also known for its extensive kuso-style parodies by subcultural content creators. Since the mid-2010s, Bilibili began to expand to a broader audience from its original niche market that focused on animation, comics, and games (ACG), and it has become a major Chinese over-the-top streaming platform serving videos on demand such as documentaries, variety shows, and other original programming.[1] Bilibili is known for its scrolling danmu (\u5f39\u5e55, \"bullet curtain\") commenting system.[2] Bilibili also provides a live streaming service where the audience can interact with streamers. Bilibili also offers games, mostly ACG-themed mobile games, such as the Chinese version of Fate/Grand Order. In the third quarter of 2022, the number of average monthly active users reached about 332.6 million, including 28.5 million paying users.[3]\n"}
