Some authorities add that an acronym must be pronounced as a single word rather than individual letters, so considering NASA an acronym but not USA;[1][2] the latter they instead call an initialism[3] or alphabetism, for a string of initial letters which are pronounced individually.[a] Acronyms commonly are formed from initials alone, such as NATO, FBI, YMCA, GIF, EMT, and PIN, but sometimes use syllables instead, as in Benelux (short for Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg), NAPOCOR (National Power Corporation), and TRANSCO (National Transmission Corporation). They can also be a mixture, as in radar (Radio Detection And Ranging) and MIDAS (Missile Defense Alarm System).\n"}
