Though movable type was already in use in East Asia, Gutenberg invented the printing press,[2] which later spread across the world.[3] His work led to an information revolution and the unprecedented mass-spread of literature throughout Europe. It had a profound impact on the development of the Renaissance, Reformation, and humanist movements.\n"}
