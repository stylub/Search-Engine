{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_video_game_graphics", "title": "Isometric video game graphics", "content": "Isometric video game graphics are graphics employed in video games and pixel art that use a parallel projection, but which angle the viewpoint to reveal facets of the environment that would otherwise not be visible from a top-down perspective or side view, thereby producing a three-dimensional (3D) effect. Despite the name, isometric computer graphics are not necessarily truly isometric\u2014i.e., the x, y, and z axes are not necessarily oriented 120\u00b0 to each other. Instead, a variety of angles are used, with dimetric projection and a 2:1 pixel ratio being the most common. The terms \"3/4 perspective\", \"3/4 view\", \"2.5D\", and \"pseudo 3D\" are also sometimes used, although these terms can bear slightly different meanings in other contexts.\n"}
