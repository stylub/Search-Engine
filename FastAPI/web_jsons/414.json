Designed as a green anthropomorphic frog with a humanoid body,  Pepe originated in Furie's 2005 comic Boy's Club.[2] The character became an Internet meme when his popularity steadily grew across websites such as Myspace, Gaia Online, and 4chan in 2008. By 2015, he had become one of the most popular memes used on 4chan and Tumblr.[3] Different types of Pepe memes include \"Sad Frog\", \"Smug Frog\", \"Angry Pepe\", \"Feels Frog\", and \"You will never...\" Frog. Since 2014, \"rare Pepes\" have been posted on the \"meme market\" as if they were trading cards.[4][5][6]\n"}
