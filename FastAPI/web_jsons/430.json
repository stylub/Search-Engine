Created by L. L. Zamenhof in 1887, it is intended to be a universal second language for international communication, or \"the international language\" (la Lingvo Internacia). Zamenhof first described the language in Dr. Esperanto's International Language (Esperanto: Unua Libro), which he published under the pseudonym Doktoro Esperanto. Early adopters of the language liked the name Esperanto and soon used it to describe his language. The word esperanto translates into English as \"one who hopes\".[9]\n"}
