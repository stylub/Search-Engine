{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language", "title": "Portuguese language", "content": "Portuguese (endonym: portugu\u00eas or, in full, l\u00edngua portuguesa) is a Western Romance language of the Indo-European language family originating from the Iberian Peninsula of Europe. It is the official language of Portugal, Brazil, Cape Verde, Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe,[6] and has co-official language status in East Timor, Equatorial Guinea, and Macau. Portuguese-speaking people or nations are known as \"Lusophones\" (lus\u00f3fonos). As the result of expansion during colonial times, a cultural presence of Portuguese speakers is also found around the world. Portuguese is part of the Ibero-Romance group that evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in the medieval Kingdom of Galicia and the County of Portugal, and has kept some Celtic phonology.[7][8]\n"}
