{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_battler", "title": "Auto battler", "content": "An auto battler, also known as auto chess, is a subgenre of strategy video games that typically feature chess-like elements where players place characters on a grid-shaped battlefield during a preparation phase, who then fight the opposing team's characters without any further direct input from the player. The genre was popularized by Dota Auto Chess in early 2019 and saw other games in the genre released soon after by more established  studios, such as Teamfight Tactics, Dota Underlords, and Hearthstone's Battlegrounds.\n"}
