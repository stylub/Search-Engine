{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language", "title": "Dutch language", "content": "Dutch (endonym: Nederlands [\u02c8ne\u02d0d\u0259rl\u0251nts] \u24d8) is a West Germanic language spoken by about 25 million people as a first language[4] and 5 million as a second language. It is the third most widely spoken Germanic language, after its close relatives English and German. Afrikaans is a separate but mutually intelligible sister language of modern Dutch, and a daughter language[a] of an earlier form of Dutch. It is spoken, to some degree, by at least 16 million people, mainly in South Africa and Namibia,[b] evolving from the Cape Dutch dialects of Southern Africa.\n"}
