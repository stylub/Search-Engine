Created in 1996 and launched to the public in 2001, it allows the user to go \"back in time\" to see how websites looked in the past. Its founders, Brewster Kahle and Bruce Gilliat, developed the Wayback Machine to provide \"universal access to all knowledge\" by preserving archived copies of defunct web pages.[1]\n"}
