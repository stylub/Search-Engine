{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alay", "title": "Alay", "content": "Alay (or 4L4Y, Anak Layangan, Anak Jablay or Anak Lebay, Indonesian pronunciation: [\u02c8alaj]) is an Indonesian pop culture phenomenon.[1] It is a stereotype describing something \"tacky\" (norak) and/or \"cheesy\" (kampungan). The Alay culture phenomena spans a wide array of styles in music, dress, and messaging. It has often been compared to that of the Jejemon phenomenon originating from the Philippines, and Harajuku from Japan. Although, the former emerged much later and the latter was even admired in the West.[2]\n"}
