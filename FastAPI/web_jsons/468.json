{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doge_(meme)", "title": "Doge (meme)", "content": "Doge (usually /do\u028ad\u0292/ DOHJ, /do\u028a\u0261/ DOHG or /do\u028a\u0292/ DOHZH)[1] is an Internet meme that became popular in 2013. The meme consists of a picture of a Shiba Inu dog, accompanied by multicolored text in Comic Sans font in the foreground. The text, representing a kind of internal monologue, is deliberately written in a form of broken English. The meme most frequently uses an image of a Shiba Inu named Kabosu, though versions with other Shiba Inus are also popular.[2]\n"}
