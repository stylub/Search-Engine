{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeklish", "title": "Greeklish", "content": "Greeklish, a portmanteau of the words Greek and English, also known as Grenglish, Latinoellinika/\u039b\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac or ASCII Greek, is the Greek language written using the Latin script. Unlike standardized systems of Romanization of Greek, as used internationally for purposes such as rendering Greek proper names or place names, or for bibliographic purposes, the term Greeklish mainly refers to informal, ad-hoc practices of writing Greek text in environments where the use of the Greek alphabet is technically impossible or cumbersome, especially in electronic media. Greeklish was commonly used on the Internet when Greek people communicate by forum, e-mail, IRC, instant messaging and occasionally on SMS, mainly because older operating systems did not support non-Latin writing systems, or in a unicode form like UTF-8. Nowadays most Greek language content appears in the Greek alphabet.\n"}
