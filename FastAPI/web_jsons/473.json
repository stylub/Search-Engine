'Martian script'), sometimes also called brain-disabled characters (simplified Chinese: \u8111\u6b8b\u4f53; traditional Chinese: \u8166\u6b98\u9ad4; pinyin: n\u01ceoc\u00e1n t\u01d0), is the nickname of unconventional representation of Chinese characters online by various methods. For example, \"\u4e00\u500b\u4eba\u7684\u6642\u5019\" (y\u012bg\u00e8r\u00e9ndesh\u00edh\u00f2u, \"When one is alone\") can be changed into \"\u3127\u310d\u4eba\u3109\u6642\u5019\" since the word \u310d (g\u0113) is consonant of \u500b and the word \u3109 (d\u0113) is consonant of the word \u7684 in bopomofo.[1]\n"}
