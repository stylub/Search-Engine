For example, daejang (\ub300\uc7a5, \"chief\") is changed into meojang (\uba38\uc7a5), since dae (\ub300) resembles meo (\uba38). The name Yaminjeongeum is a blend of Hunminjeongeum and Yagael (\uc57c\uac24); Yagael is short for Gungnae Yagu Gallery (\uad6d\ub0b4\uc57c\uad6c \uac24\ub7ec\ub9ac; \u570b\u5167\u91ce\u7403 \uac24\ub7ec\ub9ac), the domestic baseball league section of DC Inside.\n"}
