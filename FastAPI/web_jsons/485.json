{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaming_(Internet)", "title": "Flaming (Internet)", "content": "Flaming, also known as roasting, is the act of posting insults, often including profanity or other offensive language, on the internet.[1] Flaming is distinct from trolling, which is the act of someone causing discord online or in person. Flaming emerges from the anonymity that Internet forums provide for users and which allow them to act more aggressively.[2] Anonymity can lead to disinhibition, which results in the swearing, offensive, and hostile language characteristic of flaming. Lack of social cues, less accountability of face-to-face communications, textual mediation and deindividualization are also likely factors.[3] Deliberate flaming is carried out by individuals known as flamers, which are specifically motivated to incite flaming. These users specialize in flaming and target specific aspects of a controversial conversation.\n"}
