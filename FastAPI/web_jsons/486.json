{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griefer", "title": "Griefer", "content": "\nA griefer or bad-faith player is a player in a multiplayer video game who deliberately and intentionally irritates, harasses, annoys or trolls other players within the game. Griefing is often accomplished by destroying things constructed by other players, or stealing items. [1] A griefer derives pleasure from the act of annoying other users, and as such, is a nuisance in online gaming communities.\n"}
