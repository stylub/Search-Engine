{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sealioning", "title": "Sealioning", "content": "\nSealioning (also sea-lioning and sea lioning) is a type of trolling or harassment that consists of pursuing people with relentless requests for evidence, often tangential or previously addressed, while maintaining a pretense of civility and sincerity (\"I'm just trying to have a debate\"), and feigning ignorance of the subject matter.[1][2][3][4] It may take the form of \"incessant, bad-faith invitations to engage in debate\",[5] and has been likened to a  denial-of-service attack targeted at human beings.[6]  The term originated with a 2014 strip of the webcomic Wondermark by David Malki,[7] which The Independent called \"the most apt description of Twitter you'll ever see\".[8]\n"}
