{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tankie", "title": "Tankie", "content": "Tankie is a pejorative label generally applied to  authoritarian communists, especially those who support acts of repression by such regimes or their allies. More specifically, the term has been applied to those who express support for one-party Marxist\u2013Leninist socialist republics, whether contemporary or historical. It is commonly used by anti-authoritarian leftists, including anarchists, libertarian socialists, left communists, democratic socialists, liberals and reformists to criticise Leninism, although the term has seen increasing use by right\u2010wing factions as well.[5][6]\n"}
