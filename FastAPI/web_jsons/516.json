{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lurker", "title": "Lurker", "content": "In Internet culture, a lurker is typically a member of an online community who observes, but does not participate by posting.[1][2][3] The exact definition depends on context. Lurkers make up a large proportion of all users in online communities.[4] Lurking allows users to learn the conventions of an online community before they participate, improving their socialization when they eventually \"de-lurk\".[5] However, a lack of social contact while lurking sometimes causes loneliness or apathy among lurkers.[6]\n"}
