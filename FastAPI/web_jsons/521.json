{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling", "title": "Rickrolling", "content": "Rickrolling or a Rickroll is an Internet meme involving the unexpected appearance of the music video to the 1987 hit song \"Never Gonna Give You Up\", performed by English singer Rick Astley. The aforementioned video has over 1.5 billion views on YouTube. The meme is a type of bait and switch, usually using a disguised hyperlink that leads to the music video. When one clicks on a seemingly unrelated link, the site with the music video loads instead of what was expected, and they have been \"Rickrolled\". The meme has also extended to using the song's lyrics, or singing it, in unexpected contexts. Astley himself has also been Rickrolled on several occasions.[1][2][3]\n"}
