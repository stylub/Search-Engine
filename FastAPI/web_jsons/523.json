{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_63", "title": "Rule 63", "content": "Rule 63 is an Internet meme that states that, as a rule, \"for every given male character, there is a female version of that character\" and vice versa. It is one of the \"Rules of the Internet\" that began in 2006 as a Netiquette guide on 4chan and were eventually expanded upon by including deliberately mocking rules, of which Rule 63 is an example.[1] It began to see general use in fandom communities as a term to refer to both fan-made and official gender flips of existing fictional characters.\n"}
