{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanophilia", "title": "Japanophilia", "content": "Japanophilia is a strong interest in Japanese culture, people and history.[1] In Japanese, the term for Japanophile is \"shinnichi\" (\u89aa\u65e5), with \"shin (\u89aa)\" equivalent to the English prefix 'pro-' and \"nichi (\u65e5)\", meaning \"Japan\" (as in the word for Japan \"Nippon/Nihon\" (\u65e5\u672c)). The term was first used as early as the 18th century, switching in scope over time. Its opposite is Japanophobia. The study of Japan is Japanology.\n"}
