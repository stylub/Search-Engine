Kidz Bop releases compilation albums that feature children covering songs that chart high on the Billboard Hot 100 and/or receive heavy airplay from contemporary hit radio stations several months ahead of each album's release. Their cover versions sometimes contain lyrics with substitutes for the lyrics' original profanity; however, critics have commented that this does not necessarily remove the adult themes from the music[citation needed].\n"}
