{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_video_game", "title": "Nonviolent video game", "content": "Nonviolent video games are video games characterized by little or no violence. As the term is vague, game designers, developers, and marketers that describe themselves as non-violent video game makers, as well as certain reviewers and members of the non-violent gaming community, often employ it to describe games with comparatively little or no violence. The definition has been applied flexibly to games in such purposive genres as the Christian video game.[1] However, a number of games at the fringe of the \"non-violence\" label can only be viewed as objectively violent.\n"}
