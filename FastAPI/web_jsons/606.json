{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-game", "title": "Non-game", "content": "Non-games are a class of software on the border between video games and toys. The term \"non-game game\" was coined by late Nintendo president Satoru Iwata, who describes it as \"a form of entertainment that really doesn't have a winner, or even a real conclusion\".[1][failed verification] Will Wright had previously used the term \"software toy\" for the same purpose.[2][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] The main difference between non-games and traditional video games is the lack of structured goals, objectives, and challenges.[3] This allows the player a greater degree of self-expression through freeform play, since they can set up their own goals to achieve. Some genres that have been considered non-games include language-learning software, digital tabletop games, puzzle games, simulation games, and art games.\n"}
