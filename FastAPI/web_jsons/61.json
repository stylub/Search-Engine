{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loot_box", "title": "Loot box", "content": "In video game terminology, a loot box (also called a loot crate or prize crate) is a consumable virtual item which can be redeemed to receive a randomised selection of further virtual items, or loot, ranging from simple customization options for a player's avatar or character to game-changing equipment such as weapons and armor. A loot box is typically a form of monetisation, with players either buying the boxes directly or receiving the boxes during play and later buying \"keys\" with which to redeem them. These systems may also be known as gacha (based on gashapon, i.e. capsule toys), which is popular in Japan, and may be integrated into gacha games.\n"}
