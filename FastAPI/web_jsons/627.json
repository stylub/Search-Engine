{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA_(video_game_industry)", "title": "AAA (video game industry)", "content": "In the video game industry, AAA (Triple-A) is an informal classification used to classify video games produced or distributed by a mid-sized or major publisher, which typically have higher development and marketing budgets than other tiers of games.[1]  In the mid-2010s, the term \"AAA+\" was used to describe AAA type games that generated additional revenue over time, in a similar fashion to massively multiplayer online games, by using games-as-a-service methods such as season passes and expansion packs. The similar construction \"III\" (Triple-I) has also been used to describe high-production-value games in the indie game industry.\n"}
