{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_as_a_service", "title": "Games as a service", "content": "In the video game industry, games as a service (GaaS) represents providing video games or game content on a continuing revenue model, similar to software as a service. Games as a service are ways to monetize video games either after their initial sale, or to support a free-to-play model. Games released under the GaaS model typically receive a long or indefinite stream of monetized new content over time to encourage players to continue paying to support the game. This often leads to games that work under a GaaS model to be called \"living games\", \"live games\", or \"live service games\" since they continually change with these updates.\n"}
