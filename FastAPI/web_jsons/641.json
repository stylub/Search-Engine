While other video games may use in-game advertising (such as an advertisement on a virtual billboard or branding on an in-game object), an advergame is differentiated by the Interactive Advertising Bureau as a \"game specifically designed around [the] product or service being advertised\".[1] An advergame is considered a type of advertainment.\n"}
