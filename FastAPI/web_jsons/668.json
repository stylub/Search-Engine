{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_investment", "title": "Investment", "content": "Investment is traditionally defined as the \"commitment of resources to achieve later benefits\". If an investment involves money, then it can be defined as a \"commitment of money to receive more money later\". From a broader viewpoint, an investment can be defined as \"to tailor the pattern of expenditure and receipt of resources to optimise the desirable patterns of these flows\". When expenditures and receipts are defined in terms of money, then the net monetary receipt in a time period is termed cash flow, while money received in a series of several time periods is termed cash flow stream.\n"}
