{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_strategy", "title": "Exit strategy", "content": "An exit strategy is a means of leaving one's current situation, either after a predetermined objective has been achieved, or as a strategy to mitigate failure.[1][2] An organisation or individual without an exit strategy may be in a quagmire. At worst, an exit strategy will save face; at best, an exit strategy will deliver an objective worth more than the cost of continuing the execution of a previous plan considered \"deemed to fail\" by weight of the present situation.\n"}
