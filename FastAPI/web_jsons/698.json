{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_video_game_development", "title": "Indie game", "content": "An indie game, short for independent video game, is a video game created by individuals or smaller development teams without the financial and technical support of a large game publisher, in contrast to most \"AAA\" (triple-A) games. Because of their independence and freedom to develop, indie games often focus on innovation, experimental gameplay, and taking risks not usually afforded in AAA games. Indie games tend to be sold through digital distribution channels rather than at retail due to a lack of publisher support. The term is analogous to independent music or independent film in those respective mediums.\nSince AAA only refers to a games budget, rather than a studio\u2019s status, an indie developer is capable of producing a AAA game, although this is extremely rare. A prime example of a recent AAA game that was developed by an indie game developer, is Baldur\u2019s Gate 3, which was developed by indie dev, Larian Stufios. \n"}
