{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavor_text", "title": "Flavor text", "content": "Flavor text is text for action figure character backgrounds, video games, playing cards, or within the pages of a role-playing game's rulebook. While appropriate to the product's or game's story concept, it usually has no effect on the mechanics of the game, but instead serves to add realism or characterization or lore to the item in question. Flavor text is often the last text on a card or on the rear of a toy card or package, and is usually printed in italics or written between quotes to distinguish it from game-affecting text.\n"}
