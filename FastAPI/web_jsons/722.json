{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "title": "LGBT", "content": "LGBT is an initialism that stands for \"lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender\".[1][2][3][4] It may refer to anyone who is non-heterosexual, non-heteroromantic, or non-cisgender, instead of exclusively to people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender.[5] [6][7] A variant, LGBTQ, adds the letter Q for those who identify as queer (which can be synonymous with LGBT)[8] or are questioning their sexual or gender identity.[9] Another variation, LGBTQ+, adds a plus sign \"represents those who are part of the community, but for whom LGBTQ does not accurately capture or reflect their identity\".[10][11] Many further variations of the acronym exist, such as LGBT+ (simplified to encompass the Q concept within the plus sign),[12] LGBTQIA+ (adding intersex, asexual, aromantic and agender),[13] and 2SLGBTQ+ (adding two-spirit for a term specific to Indigenous North Americans). The LGBT label is not universally agreed to by everyone that it is generally intended to include.[14] The variations GLBT and GLBTQ rearrange the letters in the acronym.[15][16] In use since the late 1980s, the initialism, as well as some of its common variants, functions as an umbrella term for marginalized sexualities and gender identities.[17]\n"}
