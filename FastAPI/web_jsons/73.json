{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_and_sorcery", "title": "Sword and sorcery", "content": "Sword and sorcery (S&S) or heroic fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy characterized by sword-wielding heroes engaged in exciting and violent adventures. Elements of romance, magic, and the supernatural are also often present. Unlike works of high fantasy, the tales, though dramatic, focus on personal battles rather than world-endangering matters. Sword and sorcery commonly overlaps with heroic fantasy. The genre originated from the early-1930s works of Robert E. Howard. The term \"sword and sorcery\" was coined by Fritz Leiber in the May 1961 issue of the fantasy fanzine Amra, to describe Howard and the stories that were influenced by his works.[1] In parallel with \"sword and sorcery\", the term \"heroic fantasy\" is used, although it is a more loosely defined genre.[2]\n"}
