{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance", "title": "Quality assurance", "content": "Quality assurance (QA) is the term used in both manufacturing and service industries to describe the systematic efforts taken to assure that the product(s) delivered to customer(s) meet with the contractual and other agreed upon performance, design, reliability, and maintainability expectations of that customer. The core purpose of Quality Assurance is to prevent mistakes and defects in the development and production of both manufactured products, such as automobiles and shoes, and delivered services, such as automotive repair and athletic shoe design. Assuring quality and therefore avoiding problems and delays when delivering products or services to customers is what ISO 9000 defines as that \"part of quality management focused on providing confidence that quality requirements will be fulfilled\".[1] This defect prevention aspect of quality assurance differs from the defect detection  aspect of quality control and has been referred to as a shift left since it focuses on quality efforts earlier in product development and production (i.e., a shift to the left of a linear process diagram reading left to right)[2] and on avoiding defects in the first place rather than correcting them after the fact.\n"}
