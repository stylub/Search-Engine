{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_Protection_Act_(of_Sweden)", "title": "Employment Protection Act (of Sweden)", "content": "The Employment Protection Act, (Swedish: Lagen om anst\u00e4llningsskydd, often abbreviated as LAS) is a labour-market regulation in Sweden. The current law was adopted and entered into the Code of Statutes in 1982, when it replaced a previous Employment Protection Act from 1974. It provides extensive protection for employees from termination and regulates some employment contracts. Swedish labour market regulation generally relies heavily on collective bargaining between trade unions and Employers' organizations.[1] Even though several parts of the Employment Protection act can be overridden by collective agreements, it still constitutes an extensive direct state regulation.\n"}
