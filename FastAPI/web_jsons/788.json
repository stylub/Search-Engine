{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "title": "Sexism", "content": "Sexism is prejudice or discrimination based on one's sex or gender. Sexism can affect anyone, but primarily affects women and girls.[1] It has been linked to gender roles and stereotypes,[2][3] and may include the belief that one sex or gender is intrinsically superior to another.[4] Extreme sexism may foster sexual harassment, rape, and other forms of sexual violence.[5][6] Discrimination in this context is defined as discrimination toward people based on their gender identity[7] or their gender or sex differences.[8] An example of this is workplace inequality.[8] Sexism may arise from social or cultural customs and norms.[9]\n"}
