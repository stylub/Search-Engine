{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration_clause", "title": "Arbitration clause", "content": "In contract law, an arbitration clause is a clause in a contract that requires the parties to resolve their disputes through an arbitration process. Although such a clause may or may not specify that arbitration occur within a specific jurisdiction, it always binds the parties to a type of resolution outside the courts, and is therefore considered a kind of forum selection clause.\n"}
