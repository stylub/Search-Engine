{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton", "title": "Brighton", "content": "Brighton (/\u02c8bra\u026at\u0259n/ BRY-t\u0259n) is a seaside resort and one of the two main areas of the city of Brighton and Hove in the county of East Sussex, England. It is located 47 miles (76\u00a0km) south of London.[1]\nArchaeological evidence of settlement in the area dates back to the Bronze Age, Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods. The ancient settlement of \"Brighthelmstone\" was documented in the Domesday Book (1086). The town's importance grew in the Middle Ages as the Old Town developed, but it languished in the early modern period, affected by foreign attacks, storms, a suffering economy and a declining population. Brighton began to attract more visitors following improved road transport to London and becoming a boarding point for boats travelling to France. The town also developed in popularity as a health resort for sea bathing as a purported cure for illnesses.\n"}
