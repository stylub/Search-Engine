{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_marketing_officer", "title": "Chief marketing officer", "content": "A chief marketing officer (CMO), also called a global marketing officer or marketing director, or chief brand officer,[1][2] is a corporate executive responsible for managing marketing activities in an organization. Whilst historically these titles may have signified a legal responsibility, for example at Companies House in the UK, the titles are less strict/formal in the 21st Century and allow companies to acknowledge the evolving and increasingly significant role that marketers can play in an organisation, not least because of the inherent character of successful marketers. The CMO leads brand management, marketing communications (including advertising, promotions and public relations), market research, product marketing, distribution channel management, pricing, customer success, and customer service.[3]\n"}
