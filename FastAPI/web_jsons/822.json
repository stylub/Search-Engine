Over 10,000 jobs were lost in 2023, and an additional over 8,000 jobs were lost in 2024 from January to March.[2][3][4] These layoffs had reverberating effects on both established game development studios and emerging companies, impacting employees, projects, and the overall landscape of the gaming industry.[5] The layoffs caused several video games to be canceled, video game studios to be shut down or divested from their parent company, and thousands of employees to lose their jobs.[6]\n"}
