{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_value", "title": "Replay value", "content": "Replay value (or, colloquially, replayability) is the potential of a video game or other media products for continued play value after its first completion.[1] Factors that can influence perceived replay value include the game's extra characters, secrets and alternate endings. The replay value of a game may also be based entirely on the individual's tastes. A player might enjoy repeating a game because of the music, graphics, gameplay or because of product loyalty. Dynamic environments, challenging AI, a wide variety of ways to accomplish tasks, and a rich array of assets could result in a high replay value.[citation needed]\n"}
