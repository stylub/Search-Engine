{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forum_non_conveniens", "title": "Forum non conveniens", "content": "Forum non conveniens (Latin for \"an inconvenient forum\"[1][2][3]) (FNC) is a mostly common law legal doctrine through which a court acknowledges that another forum or court where the case might have been brought is a more appropriate venue for a legal case, and transfers the case to such a forum. A change of venue might be ordered, for example, to transfer a case to a jurisdiction within which an accident or incident underlying the litigation occurred and where all the witnesses reside.[4]\n"}
