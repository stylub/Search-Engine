It debuted in August 1991 when video game retailer FuncoLand started publishing an in-house newsletter.[2][3] The publication is now owned and published by GameStop, who bought FuncoLand in 2000. Due to this, a large amount of promotion is done in-store, which has contributed to the success of the magazine. As of June 2017, it is the 5th most popular magazine by copies circulated.\n"}
