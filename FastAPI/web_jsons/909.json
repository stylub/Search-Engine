It allows users to write blogs, keep diaries, send photos,  listen to music, and watch videos.[1] Users can set their Qzone background and select accessories based on their preferences so that every Qzone is customized to the individual member's taste. However, most Qzone accessories are not free; only after buying the \"Canary Yellow Diamond\"[2] can users access every service without paying extra.[3]\n"}
