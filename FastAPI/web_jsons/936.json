Games are available through the QQ Games client and are entirely free to play. Partnering with AOL Instant Messenger through the AIM Plugin Gallery, AIM version 6.5 and up came bundled with the English version of QQ Games. While formerly linked to AIM in such a way that an AIM screename was required to play, the English QQ Games then offered its own account registration.\n"}
