The productions of the KineticNovel label are unlike other visual novels in that  no choices are given to the player \u2013 they have only one possible outcome. The player can choose when to go to the next dialogue screen or else put the game on autoplay and just sit back and enjoy, analogous to listening to a CD or watching a DVD movie. The majority of KineticNovel's products contain adult material of a sexual nature, though all-ages products are produced as well, such as Key's Planetarian: The Reverie of a Little Planet.\n"}
